A WAV player that will have basic functionality such as play, stop, and pause as well as rudimentary vocal removal.    
I'm hoping to eventually read up on more advanced audio processing techniques like pitch and time scaling and implement those too.    
    
Right now the application has a pitch shifting example that's hard-coded (so a parameter like how much to pitch shift by can't be changed at the moment by the user) thanks to Stephan Bernsee's code (http://blogs.zynaptiq.com/bernsee/pitch-shifting-using-the-ft/).    
The algorithm takes quite a while to process the audio data.    
    
Currently this application can only play, pause, stop, and save karaoke audio.
