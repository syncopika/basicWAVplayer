playing the regular audio first to completion and then trying to
play the pitch-shifted audio also leads to segfault.

works but then crashes after the pitch-shifted audio is played.

problem was that the wrong numbers were being used with SoundTouch's sendSamples() and receiveSamples()

In each thread spawned when we play (assuming current state is STOPPED), we do update some global variables.
should we lock them? namely currentDeviceID and currentState. maybe can move currentState update outside of thread control
and rethink play/pause/stop logic.
