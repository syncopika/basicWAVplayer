- improve visualization part
  - pretty buggy stil with stop and play for some reason.

- try allowing time stretching as well? (change tempo w/o modifying pitch)
  - looks like it's supported by SoundTouch: https://codeberg.org/soundtouch/soundtouch/src/branch/master/source/SoundTouch/SoundTouch.cpp#L32

- timestamp? marker to show how many seconds has elapsed, total time to play
